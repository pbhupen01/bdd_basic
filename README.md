# In BDD behaviour drives the development.

# 1. First write behaviours (tests in human-readable language) for new feature which doesn't exist
# 2. New tests are executed to verify that they fail
# 3. Implement all the test cases TDD
# 4. Feature is implemented for all the new tests
# 5. Tests are run again to verify that tests pass
